# Blueprint projects around the Eclipse Automotive API Framework

This repository includes the following blueprint projects: 

| Folder | Project description | 
| ------ | ------------------- | 
| [bp-vss-vaf](./bp-vss-vaf/) | This project demonstrates the combined usage of the [VSS catalogue editing tool](https://github.com/eclipse-autoapiframework/vss-gui-tool) and the [Application Framework](https://github.com/eclipse-autoapiframework/application-framework). The scenario for this example is a simple speed hazard detection application. | 
| [bp-ifex-vaf](./bp-ifex-vaf/) | This project extends the previous blueprint by exchanging VSS with the [Interface Exchange (IFEX)](https://covesa.global/project/interface-exchange/) format for the representation of the signal catalogue. |
